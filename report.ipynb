    "## Project Summary: \n",
    "\n",
    "The project investigates the relationship between various socioeconomic factors - such as poverty, age distribution, cost of living, racial and ethnic minority status, and others - and the distribution of married vs. unmarried couples across counties in the United States. The analysis uses 2020 data from the Social Vulnerability Index and five years of household data from the American Community Survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this relationship, the student first applies clustering based on five key features, one of which is the slope of the best-fit curve to household data. This slope acts as a filtering feature, where polynomials with an $R^2 < 0.6$ are considered noisy and removed from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the student uses a random forest model to predict the cluster classes. The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using cross-validation. The prediction error is slightly above the random guessing error rate, indicating that the model has reasonable predictive power."

    "The student does not provide graphs to illustrate the results of the cross-validation of the random forest model. Visual representations would have made it easier to understand the results and the conclusions drawn from them. Additionally, graphs highlighting the important features would have strengthened the argument and supported the conclusions more effectively. Furthermore, it would have been helpful if the student added some examples of the raw data and the data after computing and normalizing the features. "

    "While the student mentioned that they normalized the features (with the exception for the best fit curve, which is binary), I believe that they did not take into account the percentage change of population, rather, they took the absolute change. If I understand the code correctly, right now the \"slope\" and \"acceleration\" features are raw counts of households per year, so two counties with the same percentage growth but different base populations end up too far away. In order to fix this issue, I recommend looking at the percentage change. "
